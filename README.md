# _Graded_

#### By _**Caitlin Ashtari**, 3/10/2017_

## Description

During this tumultuous time, when the future of our public school system hangs in the balance and parent choice plays heavily into the dynamics of our classrooms, under-represented populations need tools to increase awareness around their child(ren)'s education. Often, these populations go uninformed of their options, the reputation of the teachers instructing their children, and the power they have over their children's future. Graded will provide these parents and their students with the full transparency needed to strengthen their voices when it comes to public education. Graded will allow parents and students to share their teacher and school experiences with users across the platform through teacher and school reviews. From these reviews and ratings, parents will have the knowledge needed to identify teachers and schools nearby that will best meet the needs of their children.
